Breakout in HTML5
========================

##About##

Breakout in HTML5 is a simple weekend project I've been developing using canvas and Box2D physics engine for Javascript.

I release only the JS source of the demo, as you can easily deploy it to a page using [HTML5 Boilerplate template](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate) by Paul Irish or you can just create a page with a div id="main" in it to host the game.

##Required libraries##

* [jQuery (1.5.1+)](http://jquery.com)
* [Box2D.js](https://github.com/jwagner/box2d2-js)

##New features in last version##

* Countdown timer when you begin playing
* Score bubles when ball hits the bricks
* Few finetuning in ball velocity in order not to get stuck in vertical or horizontal moves

##Features##

* Uses requestAnimationFrame
* Optimized for iOS devices (although they are not recommended for gameplay as canvas in mobile Safari is pretty slow)
* User score, game over screen

##Future possible features##

* Sounds
* Leaderboards
* ???
